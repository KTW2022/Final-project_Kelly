11/1 is typically the last standard freeze date across all populations, so it's not unreasonable for schools to have the CDS ready for stakeholder review on that day.
I think that the current template formats are past their prime.
The timing is fine.
release date is way too late - needs to be released in September or earlier to collect information across departments  explore a common submission format for the publishers such as a standardized XML to eliminate re-typing
Excel template has many rows not adjusted properly to display all text.
I know they often offer the option of having them manually key-in our data into their systems, but I don't know of other institutions that trust that process so we end up spending a lot of time typing in to the US News Best Colleges, Princeton Review and College Board BigFuture portals.
I find the CDS extremely useful in gathering common data for the various college search groups.
After fall census and prior to spring ranking surveys.
This would allow us to make sure we collect needed data rather than going back and having to gather different data.
The main feedback I have is to request that ADA accessibility of the form be addressed.
If we are to post the CDS on our website, it must conform to accessibility standards, and it take time to modify the current form to meet the standards.
The analysts would finish their work and be able to record the information one time instead of having to come back to do the calculations.
Most institutions are collecting and/or finalizing their fall enrollment census data by mid-to-late September.
Every year IR offices are clamoring to get the new version of the CDS, and often must begin populating last year's template as a place-holder, wasting time and resources when the new template must then be filled in.
Each publisher could then just solicit the information specific to their survey instead of needing schools to repetitively answer the same data.
We never use the Word template.
The release date works well with our reporting cycles - so no comments there.
I feel like communication about timing was better this year, and that's what's really important.
The Tabs are named A-J, which is useless for most humans.
Many annual surveys open at the same time each year, and the CDS should follow suite, with a release data of September 1 annually, or something similar.
Have a SOLID date when the CDS will be available.
The Excel file has lots of inconsistent and wonky formatting.
Some things in numbers, others in percentages, lots of merged cells, etc.
The definitions also need to be far more specific -- more than one would think, as this eliminates opportunities for different institutions to define terms in a different manner.
It would be helpful if the tuition/fees was the current year, not the future year.
Since the CDS is usually released in late October/early November, I usually refer to the previous year's format and begin completing the questionnaire in September.
First, the release of the CDS in mid-October is way too late.
Also, there should be instructions regarding online enrollment.
It doesn't make sense to know how many online are not in campus housing because these students will never interact with the online students.
It is time to move past Microsoft Word and Excel.
That is a very crazy time for IR with federal, state, and system reporting demands.
