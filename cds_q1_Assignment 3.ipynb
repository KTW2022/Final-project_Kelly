        "This project is to analyze participants' narrative responses to one of the open-ended survey questions that were administered in Octobor 2021. Participants were asked about how they thought of the release date and template of the Common Data Set (CDS) survey in the field of institutional research. It is being heard that institutional research analysts in different universities have been complaining about the release date and the template of the survey. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, no one really gathers people's opinions on the issues. One of the reasons is that institutional research analysts are always busy with many tasks and analyzing qualitative data takes time, so people are intimidated to administer an open-ended survey, which in fact can provide in-depth information. \n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, the goal of this project is to utilize a supervised learning method-- K Nearnest Neighbors (KNN) to build a model to help identify the most likely label of each sentence from the responses. Two calculation methods, namely TF-IDF scores and sentence embeddings were used to compare the accuracy rates. The purpose of examing the accuracy rate is to know which calculation method is better. Additionally, a discussion will be provided regarding the possible reasons that one method is better than the other and how to improve the model.\n",

        "The accuracy rate using the TF-IDF score for labeling is 0.71, while that using the sentence embeddings for labeliing is 0.77. A possible reason that the sentence embeddings method is better than the TF-IDF method is that the sentence embeddings are based on certain features of the words, while TF-IDF score is based on the occurrences of words. The method based on the occurrences of words has a problem that it works well when the content of the text is general, not domain-specific, but when it deals with domain-specific texts, certain important words of the domain can be mentioned many times across the texts, but because they occur almost everywhere, the imporance of the words will be reduced by the TF-IDF method. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the survey is domain-specific, some important words such as CDS, release date, template, etc. occur in many sentences. According to the formula of TF-IDF, the importance of these words can be reduced, affecting the acuracy of the prediction. \n",

        "This project collects only 159 sentences. The scale of the dataset is small. To improve the model, more data points can be added in the future when more survey responses are collected. Other ways to improve the model includes:\n",
        "1. On the stage of data cleaning, the stopwords, punctunations, and non-utf characters can be removed before further analysis.  \n",
        "2. Use HuggingFace's default part of speech (pos) tagger, a variant of the token classification task, to identify and extract only nouns, proper nouns , and adjectives. These words are usually more meaningful than others.\n",
        "3. After the predicted labels of some sentences were corrected, analyze the reason that some sentences were predicted incorrectly. If necessary, create new labels for those sentences and run the model again. This step may be repeated a few times until the accuracy rate is satisfied. "
